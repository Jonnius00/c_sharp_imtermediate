# Mosh Hamedani C# Intermediate Exercises

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from Mosh Hamedani's C# Intermediate course. The project is designed for self-study and practice, focusing on object-oriented programming concepts and .NET Framework 4.7.2.

## Project Structure

- **_imtermediate/StopWatch.cs**  
  Implements a custom `StopWatch` class that simulates a stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionality. It demonstrates exception handling and proper state management.

- **_imtermediate/StackOverflowPost.cs**  
  Models a simple StackOverflow post with properties for title, description, creation time, and voting (upvote/downvote). It demonstrates encapsulation and basic class design.

- **_imtermediate/Program.cs**  
  Entry point for the application. Allows the user to select and run either the StopWatch or StackOverflowPost exercise from the console.

## How to Run

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Build the project (targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2).
3. Run the application.  
   You will be prompted to choose an exercise:
   - Enter `1` for the StopWatch demo.
   - Enter `2` for the StackOverflowPost demo.

## Learning Goals

- Practice with C# classes, properties, and methods.
- Understand encapsulation and state management.
- Implement simple exception handling.
- Gain experience with console applications in .NET.

## Notes

- This project is for educational purposes and follows the coding style and requirements from the course exercises.
- All code is self-contained and can be extended for further practice.
